We are trying to list all the important values and characteristics that exist in the world, and map them in a web form so that everyone can fill in as much as they want. That is, he can say himself what and why he wants to publish. Once you are registered, you can make friends on the platform just like on other social media networks. You can then by means of authorization under each field that we have created, who may see this field of all topics of the mind map. Say, only me(for drafts that you don't want to publish yet), all my friends or just the whole network. Further you can still create groups under the friends. So you can set the permission even finer. For example, you can make a group Employers, and add there all employers who are friends with you. Thus, only this field can see who was also added by you in this group. If you need information now, we have added a search mask, with which you can search through the mindmap network. The profiles can only be seen by users who are registered with us. And then simply by permission, which you set when filling out your profile.\nThis is how you can create your own logical profile with us and how you can specify exactly who should receive or see what information.",

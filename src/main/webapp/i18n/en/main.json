    "intro": "From a mind map using brainstorming to a form generator, everything is included with Create Your Humanity, with which we would like to make a kind of world map in the near future. The idea is that we capture the earth and all its values using a mind map diagram. You can easily expand, change and delete this mind map in the future. These topics are then assigned to a control element using the mind map editor so that a web form can be generated from this mind map. You can now use this web form to write down all your personal values and characteristics and then save them. You can then view the profiles of our members, depending on which permissions have been set. Everyone can define for themselves whether and who is allowed to view or read through this topic. In this way you can develop a personal profile for yourself, so that you can be found on the Internet, so to speak, with your CV.",

Actually, it's more of a library that we want to create, which defines questions for many of our answers that have never been asked before. Complete this mind map fairly, honestly, and openly so it can get the maximum output from your input. You can easily form new colleges, new workers, new family members and many other interest groups. Due to the fact that it is structured logically, anyone can now easily find you in whatever fields you have published due to this structure. All of the fields seen on the mind map above are separate separate controls on an HTML form. Depending on how much you want to publish, you can do that too. It's up to you how much that is...furthermore you can publish this to everyone, only to friends or not at all. In this way, you can further narrow down the group that needs to find this information. We hope you enjoy creating your online CV.",
